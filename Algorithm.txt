1) Take the following inputs: 
    - Starting Station
    - Starting Path 
    - Ending Station 
    - Ending Path 
2) Check to see if the starting and ending station are in the same path: 
    2.1) compare starting path with ending path 
        2.1.1) if true: 
            2.1.1.1) Declare indexStartingStation and set it to the index of the starting station in the starting path array. 
            2.1.1.2) Declare indexEndingStation and set it to the index of the ending statio in the starting path array. 
            2.1.1.3) Declare min variable and set it to the smaller index of the two stations. 
            2.1.1.4) Declare max variable and set it to the larger index of the two stations. 
            2.1.1.5) Declare numStation and set it to (min - max)
            2.1.1.6) Return numStation
        2.1.2) if false: 
            2.1.2.1) Declare indexStartingStation and set it to the index of the starting station in the starting path array.
            2.1.2.2) Declare indexEndingStation and set it to the index of the ending station in the ending path array. 
            2.1.2.3) Declare indexParkStreetStartingPathStation and set it to the index of the Park Street station in the starting path array. 
            2.1.2.4) Declare indexParkStreetEndingPathStation and set it to the index of the Park Street station in the ending path array. 
            2.1.2.5) Declare minStartingPath and set it to the smaller index of indexStartingStation and indexParkStreetStartingPathStation.
            2.1.2.6) Declare maxStartingPath and set it to the larger index of indexStartingStation and indexParkStreetStartingPathStation.
            2.1.2.7) Declare minEndingPath and set it to the smaller index of indexEndingStation and indexParkStreetEndingPathStation.
            2.1.2.8) Declare maxEndingPath and set it to the larger index of indexEndingStation and indexParkStreetEndingPathStation.
            2.1.2.9) Declare numStationStartingPath and set it to (maxStartingPath - minStartingPath)
            2.1.2.10) Declare numStationEndingPath and set it to (maxEndingPath - minEndingPath)
            2.1.2.11) Declare numStation and set it to (numStationStartingPath + numStationEndingPath)
            2.1.2.12) Return numStation
